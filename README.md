# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Fasten Your Seatbelts

## Description
This is my first project ever. The goal of this project was to become familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The project was done for a Dutch travel company. They wanted a product that would link solo travelers together based on similar hobbies/interests.


## Installation
This project can be hosted upon the localhost.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
